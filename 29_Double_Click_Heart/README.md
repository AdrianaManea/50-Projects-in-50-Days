- Double click on the image to heart it
- When !! anywhere on this image a heart will pop up - a css grow animation
- shows how many times !!
- js

  - set !! event and insert a heart in the exact position where we click
  - on the event object clientX and clientY values
  - event target offsetLeft, offsetTop so we can tell exactly where the element comes in from
    because we need to calculate it in in order to find the exact position of the image

  - create a sg! event and create our own !! event based on the time/space between clicks
