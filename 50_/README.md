  - 2 - the game - when click on a cat, two more appear and so on for infinite times
    - whats going to place .purrr in a random spot is position absolute; and top and left with random values with JS
    - also transform: translate(-50%, -50%) and to scale(1) by default because with scale(0) will make it disappear when click on it with JS
