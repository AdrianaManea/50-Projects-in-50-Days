## 3D Boxes Project

- modern CSS to create 3D effect
- background image or a background gif for each of our boxes. All the same img/gif. Extend the background size beyond thr single box to make it as big as your container.
- dynamically calculate the background position so we can move boxes around in order to form one big image.
- add event listener onto the button
- when click and hold the button (when it's in it's active state) it moves down a litte bit and gets rid of the box shadow / it gives the effect that it gets over the box shadow (.magic:active)
- the spaces in between boxes disappears, it comes all together so it will looks like a connected image
- rotate effect on each box

- CSS transform, transition, aftert an before pseudo selectors
- loop in JS to go through the boxes and calculate the background position
- JS event listener onto the button
